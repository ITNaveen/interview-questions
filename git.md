# Git Commands Explained: Fetch, Pull, Reset, Revert, Merge, Rebase, and More

## 1. `git pull` vs `git fetch`

### `git fetch`
- Downloads changes from the remote repository but does not update your local branch.
- Useful for reviewing changes before merging them into your branch.

**Real-Life Example:**
Imagine you are working on a feature branch (`feature-login`). Your teammate has pushed some updates to `main`, but you are unsure about those changes and do not want to merge them yet. You use `git fetch` to see the updates before deciding to merge.

**Example Commands:**
```sh
# Fetch changes from the remote repository
$ git fetch origin
# Check the logs to see the new commits
$ git log origin/main --oneline
```

### `git pull`
- Fetches changes and automatically merges them into your local branch.
- Useful when you want to update your branch immediately.

**Real-Life Example:**
You are working on `main`, and you want to ensure that your local copy has the latest updates from the remote repository before making new changes.

**Example Commands:**
```sh
# Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository
$ git pull origin main
```

## 2. `git reset` vs `git revert`

### `git reset`
- Moves the branch pointer to a previous commit, discarding changes.
- Can be used to remove commits from history (soft, mixed, or hard reset).

**Real-Life Example:**
You committed sensitive API keys by mistake. You want to completely remove the commit from history before pushing to the remote repository.

**Example Commands:**
```sh
# Remove last commit permanently (Dangerous if already pushed!)
$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### `git revert`
- Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit.
- Preserves history, making it safer for shared branches.

**Real-Life Example:**
A team member pushed a commit that broke the production build. Instead of deleting history, you use `git revert` to create a new commit that undoes the bad changes.

**Example Commands:**
```sh
# Revert a commit and create a new commit with the rollback
$ git revert <commit-hash>
```

## 3. `git merge` vs `git rebase`

### `git merge`
- Combines two branches, preserving the commit history.
- Creates a new merge commit.

**Real-Life Example:**
You have completed a feature (`feature-dashboard`) and want to merge it into `main` while keeping track of all individual commits from the feature branch.

**Example Commands:**
```sh
# Merge feature branch into main
$ git checkout main
$ git merge feature-dashboard
```

### `git rebase`
- Moves the feature branch onto the latest commit of the main branch.
- Results in a linear commit history.

**Real-Life Example:**
You are working on a long-running feature (`feature-reporting`). Meanwhile, `main` has received multiple updates. Instead of merging and creating unnecessary merge commits, you rebase your feature branch to keep a clean history.

**Example Commands:**
```sh
# Rebase feature branch onto main
$ git checkout feature-reporting
$ git rebase main
```

## 4. Why is my repo "4 commits ahead"?
- This happens when your local branch has commits that are not present in the remote repository.
- You need to push your changes to sync with the remote.

**Real-Life Example:**
You worked on a few fixes locally and committed them but forgot to push them. When you check `git status`, you see "4 commits ahead of origin/main".

**Example Commands:**
```sh
# Push your local commits to remote
$ git push origin main
```
- If you did not intend to be ahead, you may need to rebase or reset your branch.

**Example Commands:**
```sh
# Rebase your branch onto the remote
$ git pull --rebase origin main
```

## 5. Other Common Git Issues

### Undoing the Last Commit Without Losing Changes
**Real-Life Example:**
You committed a file, but then realized you forgot to add another important change. You want to modify the commit before pushing.

```sh
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
- This keeps your changes but removes the commit.

### Stashing Changes Before Switching Branches
**Real-Life Example:**
You are working on `feature-payment`, but your manager asks you to switch to `bugfix-login` for an urgent fix. You need to save your work before switching branches.

```sh
$ git stash
$ git checkout bugfix-login
$ git stash pop
```
- Use this to save temporary work before switching branches.

### Deleting a Local Branch After Merging
**Real-Life Example:**
You finished working on a feature (`feature-analytics`), merged it into `main`, and now want to remove it from your local system to keep things clean.

```sh
$ git branch -d feature-analytics
```
- Use `-D` to force delete if the branch is not merged.

### Force Syncing a Local Branch with Remote
**Real-Life Example:**
Your local branch has diverged significantly from `main`, and you want to discard all local changes and match the remote repository.

```sh
$ git fetch origin
$ git reset --hard origin/main
```
