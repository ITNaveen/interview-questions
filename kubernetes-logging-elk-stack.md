# Kubernetes Logging with Elasticsearch, FluentBit, and Kibana: A DevOps Guide

## 1. Understanding the Components

### Elasticsearch
- **What is Elasticsearch?**
  - A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene
  - Primary data store for logs, metrics, and application data
  - Scales horizontally through shards and replicas

- **Key Elasticsearch Concepts**
  - **Index**: Collection of documents with similar characteristics
  - **Document**: JSON object containing data stored in Elasticsearch
  - **Shard**: Horizontal partition of an index (for scaling)
  - **Replica**: Copy of a shard (for high availability)
  - **Node**: Single Elasticsearch instance
  - **Cluster**: Collection of nodes that together hold your data

### FluentBit
- **What is FluentBit?**
  - Lightweight log processor and forwarder
  - Designed specifically for Kubernetes environments
  - Collects logs from various sources and forwards them to destinations like Elasticsearch

- **Comparison with Fluentd**
  - FluentBit is more resource-efficient (written in C vs Ruby)
  - Lower memory footprint (~650KB vs ~40MB)
  - Better suited for containerized environments
  - Fluentd has more plugins and broader ecosystem support

### Kibana
- **What is Kibana?**
  - Visualization layer for data in Elasticsearch
  - Provides UI for searching, viewing, and interacting with logs
  - Enables creation of dashboards, charts, and time-series analyses

## 2. Architecture of Logging in Kubernetes

### End-to-End Flow
1. Applications generate logs in containers
2. FluentBit DaemonSet runs on every node
3. FluentBit collects logs from:
   - Container stdout/stderr
   - Log files on host
   - Kubernetes metadata
4. FluentBit processes logs (parsing, filtering, enrichment)
5. FluentBit forwards logs to Elasticsearch
6. Elasticsearch indexes and stores logs
7. Kibana visualizes logs from Elasticsearch

### Deployment Options
- **Operator-based**: Using Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)
- **Helm Charts**: Using community-maintained charts
- **Manual Deployment**: Custom manifests for each component
- **Managed Service**: Using cloud provider offerings (AWS, GCP, Azure)

              "max_age": "1d",
              "max_size": "50gb"
            },
            "set_priority": {
              "priority": 100
            }
          }
        },
        "warm": {
          "min_age": "2d",
          "actions": {
            "shrink": {
              "number_of_shards": 1
            },
            "forcemerge": {
              "max_num_segments": 1
            },
            "set_priority": {
              "priority": 50
            }
          }
        },
        "delete": {
          "min_age": "30d",
          "actions": {
            "delete": {}
          }

## 10. Interview Q&A

### Basic Concepts

**Q: What is the role of each component in the ELK stack?**

A: The ELK stack (now commonly including FluentBit, so EFBK) has distinct responsibilities:
- Elasticsearch: Distributed search and analytics engine that stores logs
- FluentBit: Log collector that runs on Kubernetes nodes, processes, and forwards logs
- Kibana: Visualization platform that provides UI for searching and analyzing logs

**Q: Why use FluentBit instead of Fluentd in Kubernetes?**

A: FluentBit is preferred in Kubernetes environments because:
- Lower resource footprint (650KB vs 40MB for Fluentd)
- Written in C (vs Ruby) for better performance
- Designed specifically for containerized environments
- Simpler configuration for common use cases
- However, Fluentd still has advantages when complex routing or extensive plugin use is required

**Q: How does FluentBit collect logs in Kubernetes?**

A: FluentBit collects logs in Kubernetes through:
- Running as a DaemonSet on every node
- Tailing container log files (typically in `/var/log/containers/`)
- Parsing log formats (JSON, CRI, etc.)
- Enriching logs with Kubernetes metadata (pod, namespace, labels)
- Buffering logs in memory or on disk before forwarding
- Transmitting logs to Elasticsearch via its API

### Advanced Concepts

**Q: How would you design a logging architecture for multiple Kubernetes clusters across regions?**

A: For multi-cluster, multi-region logging:
1. Deploy local FluentBit instances in each cluster
2. Configure regional Elasticsearch clusters for initial storage
3. Implement cross-cluster replication to a global Elasticsearch cluster
4. Use cluster-specific index naming (e.g., `logs-us-west-cluster1-YYYY.MM.DD`)
5. Configure cross-cluster search in Kibana for global visibility
6. Implement federated authentication across all components
7. Consider data locality requirements for compliance

**Q: How would you handle log volume spikes without losing data?**

A: To handle log volume spikes:
1. Configure persistent buffering in FluentBit with disk-based storage
2. Implement back-pressure handling with retry logic
3. Set up scaling policies for Elasticsearch based on indexing load
4. Use dedicated coordinating nodes to handle ingest traffic
5. Configure adaptive batch sizes for log transmission
6. Implement priority-based log handling for critical vs. non-critical logs
7. Establish monitoring on queue sizes and buffer utilization
8. Have overflow storage for extreme cases (e.g., S3 backup output)

**Q: How would you secure the logging infrastructure in a multi-tenant Kubernetes environment?**

A: For secure multi-tenant logging:
1. Implement namespace-based index isolation (one index per namespace)
2. Use Elasticsearch security features for role-based access (Security plugin)
3. Configure field-level security for sensitive data
4. Implement TLS for all communication between components
5. Add audit logging for access to the logging infrastructure
6. Use OIDC/SAML integration with the organization's IAM
7. Consider tokenization or masking of sensitive fields at collection time
8. Deploy logging components in dedicated namespaces with strict network policies

### Troubleshooting Scenarios

**Q: Elasticsearch is reporting a yellow cluster status. What might be the causes and how would you troubleshoot?**

A: A yellow status indicates unassigned replica shards but all primary shards are allocated. To troubleshoot:
1. Check cluster health with `GET /_cluster/health`
2. Identify unassigned shards with `GET /_cat/shards?v&h=index,shard,prirep,state,unassigned.reason`
3. Get detailed allocation explanation with `GET /_cluster/allocation/explain`
4. Common causes include:
   - Insufficient disk space
   - Node failures
   - Shard allocation settings
   - Number of nodes less than replica count
5. Solutions:
   - Add more nodes if replicas can't be allocated
   - Increase disk space
   - Adjust replica count with `PUT /my-index/_settings { "index": { "number_of_replicas": 1 } }`
   - Check and fix allocation settings

**Q: Logs are being collected but not appearing in Elasticsearch. How would you troubleshoot?**

A: To troubleshoot missing logs in Elasticsearch:
1. Check FluentBit status and logs: `kubectl logs -n logging -l app=fluent-bit`
2. Verify FluentBit is successfully connecting to Elasticsearch:
   ```
   kubectl exec -it -n logging fluent-bit-xxx -- curl elasticsearch-master:9200
   ```
3. Check for Elasticsearch rejections in logs
4. Verify index patterns: `GET /_cat/indices?v`
5. Check for parsing errors in FluentBit
6. Verify output configuration (hostname, port, TLS settings)
7. Check Elasticsearch disk space and quota limits
8. Try manually sending a test document to Elasticsearch
9. Check for network policies blocking traffic

**Q: Your Elasticsearch cluster is running out of disk space. What are your immediate and long-term solutions?**

A: Immediate solutions:
1. Identify large indices: `GET /_cat/indices?v&s=store.size:desc`
2. Delete old indices: `DELETE /logstash-2021.01.*`
3. Force merge to reclaim deleted document space: `POST /my-index/_forcemerge`
4. Increase disk space if possible

Long-term solutions:
1. Implement Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)
2. Configure index rollover based on size and age
3. Set up automated deletion or archiving of old indices
4. Move to hot-warm-cold architecture with tiered storage
5. Implement log sampling for high-volume, low-value logs
6. Optimize mappings to reduce storage requirements
7. Configure field exclusion for large, unnecessary fields

**Q: Applications are generating malformed logs that break your parsing. How do you handle this?**

A: To handle malformed logs:
1. Implement fallback parsers in FluentBit:
   ```
   [PARSER]
       Name fallback
       Format regex
       Regex (.*)
       Key_Name log
   ```
2. Add error handling in your parser configuration:
   ```
   [FILTER]
       Name parser
       Match *
       Key_Name log
       Parser json
       Reserve_Data On
       Preserve_Key On
   ```
3. Set up a separate pipeline for unparsed logs:
   ```
   [OUTPUT]
       Name es
       Match unparsed.*
       Host elasticsearch
       Index unparsed-logs
   ```
4. Create monitoring for parsing failures
5. Long-term: Work with development teams to standardize log formats
